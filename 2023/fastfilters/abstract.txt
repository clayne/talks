Title: Binary Fuse Filters: Fast and Tiny Immutable Filters


Abstract:

Conventional Bloom filters provide fast approximate set membership while using 
little memory. Engineers use them to avoid expensive disk and network accesses.
We recently introduced the binary fuse filters that are faster and smaller 
at query time while saving at least 30% in memory usage compared to the Bloom filters.
The result is an immutable filter, and the construction is slightly slower (e.g., by 50%).

We review some performance issues related to our binary fuse filters, but also to 
probabilistic filters in general: e.g., how does the query time performance scale with respect
to the number of random accesses ? For network transmission, the filters are often compressed:
how well do different filters compress ?
