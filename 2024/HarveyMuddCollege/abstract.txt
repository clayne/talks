Converting decimal numbers to binary: reaching gigabytes per second

With disks and networks delivering gigabytes per second, reading decimal numbers within XML, JSON and CSV files becomes a bottleneck. We consider the problem of converting decimal numbers to the nearest floating binary value. We present a C++ implementation that is often 4 times faster than the standard C library on modern 64-bit systems (Intel, AMD, ARM and POWER9). Our work is available as open source software used by major systems such as Rust, Go, LLVM libc, GNU stdlib++ (GCC).
